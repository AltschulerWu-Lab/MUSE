## Overview

Decomposing cell heterogeniety of complex biological systems is an important step to the comprehensive understanding of their organizations and mechanisms.  Morphologies are the most direct and distinguishable  features for  cell differences.  Single-cell profiling from morphologies has been a powerful and widely used tool to characterize cell identities and quantify cellular/subcellular dynamics at high temporal/spatial resolution and large scale. Complementarily, transcriptional profiles represent  cellular activities. The transcriptional differences among cells can reveal different cell states, linages and subpopulations. With the development of single-cell spatial transcriptomics, we can profile morpholigiclal and transcriptonal properties from the same cell simutaneously. We developed the multi-modality structural embedding (MUSE), a deep learning approach that aggregates the heterogeneity from morphologies and transcripts and dissects cell subpopulations at finer resolution.


MUSE combines features from transcripts (x) and morphology (y) into a joint latent representation z.The self-reconstruction loss encourages the learned joint feature representation (z) to faithfully retain information from the original individual input feature modalities (x and y). The self-supervised learning exploits triple-loss functions to encourage cells with the same cluster label (i.e. with the same pseudo label in either l<sub>x</sub> or l<sub>y</sub>) to remain close—and cells with different cluster labels to remain far apart—in the joint latent space.

## MUSE software package

DAK requires the following packages for installation:

- Python >= 3.6
- TensorFlow-GPU >= 1.4.1
- (TensorFlow >= 1.4.1 if only use CPU) 
- Numpy >= 1.13.0
- Scipy >= 1.0.0
- phenograph >=


## Usage

### Import MUSE python package
After installation, import MUSE by

```python
import muse_sc as muse
```

### Learn MUSE features on multi-modality data
MUSE requires feature matrices (`data_x` and `data_y`) and inital sample labels (`label_x` and `label_y`) from two modalities for model training. 

```python
z, x_hat, y_hat, h_x, h_y = muse.muse_fit_predict(data_x,
                                                  data_y,
                                                  label_x,
                                                  label_y,
                                                  latent_dim=100,
                                                  n_epochs=500,
                                                  lambda_regul=5,
                                                  lambda_super=5)
```
where 

```
Parameters:

  data_x:       input for transcript modality; matrix of  n * p, where n = number of cells, p = number of genes.
  data_y:       input for morphological modality; matrix of n * q, where n = number of cells, q is the feature dimension.
  label_x:      initial reference cluster label for transcriptional modality.
  label_y:      inital reference cluster label for morphological modality.
  latent_dim:   feature dimension of joint latent representation.
  n_epochs:     maximal epoch used in training.
  lambda_regul: weight for regularization term in the loss function.
  lambda_super: weight for supervised learning loss in the loss function.


Outputs:

  z:            joint latent representation learned by MUSE.
  x_hat:        reconstructed feature matrix corresponding to input data_x.
  y_hat:        reconstructed feature matrix corresponding to input data_y.
  h_x:          modality-specific latent representation corresponding to data_x.
  h_y:          modality-specific latent representation corresponding to data_y.
```

Inital reference labels (`label_x` and `label_y`) can either be provided by a modality-specific method (eg. use scScope for transcript feature learning and obtain cell clusters) or simply use general feature learning and cluster methods. We provide a demonstration to use PCA to get reference labels in `MUSE_demo.ipynb`.

### Subpopulation analysis
After learning joint latent representations from both modalities by MUSE, subpopulations in the tissue can be discovered by PhenoGraph (https://github.com/jacoblevine/PhenoGraph). It can automatically determine the optimal cluster number. 

```python
import phenograph
label_MUSE, _,  _ = phenograph.cluster(z)

```
